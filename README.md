This is the final assignment I did for my datastructures class. In this assignment, I implemented a directred graph and an undirected graph.
The undirected graph has the following characteristics: undirected, unweighted, no duplicate edges, and no loops.
The directed graph has the following characteristics: directed, weighted (positive edge weights only),no duplicate edges, and no loops.
